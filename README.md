This repo showcases the various Codewars practice problems I've completed.

Contents:

<b>SquareDigits.java</b> -
In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number.
For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

<b>UniqueInOrder.js</b> -
Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.

<b>WhoLikesIt.cs</b> -
You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.
Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take in input array, containing the names of people who like an item. For 4 or more names, the number in and 2 others simply increases.

<b>BitCounting.cs</b> -
Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.
Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case
