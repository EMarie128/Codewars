This repo showcases the various Codewars practice problems I've completed.

<h2>Contents:</h2>

<h3>Java</h3>
  
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>SquareDigits.java</b> - <br>
     In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number.
     For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <b>CountingDuplicates.java</b> - <br>
    Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input       string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <b>Vowels.java</b> - <br>
    Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.
    We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).
    The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <b>FindOutlier.java</b> - <br>
    You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or           entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <b>RowSumOddNumbers.java</b> - <br>
    Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:
                 1
              3     5
           7     9    11
       13    15    17    19
    21    23    25    27    29
    ...
    Calculate the row sums of this triangle from the row index (starting at index 1).
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <b>Diamond.java</b> - <br>
    IN PROGRESS<br>
    Jamie is a programmer, and James' girlfriend. She likes diamonds, and wants a diamond string from James. Since James doesn't know how to make this happen, he needs your         help.
    You need to return a string that looks like a diamond shape when printed on the screen, using asterisk (*) characters. Trailing spaces should be removed, and every line must     be terminated with a newline character.
    Return null/nil/None/... if the input is an even number or negative, as it is not possible to print a diamond of even or negative size.
    Example<br>
    A size 3 diamond:<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp*<br>
    ***<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp*<br>
    ...which would appear as a string of " *\n***\n *\n"
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <b>Validate.java</b> - <br>
    In this Kata, you will implement the Luhn Algorithm, which is used to help validate credit card numbers.
    Given a positive integer of up to 16 digits, return true if it is a valid credit card number, and false if it is not.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <b>NumberFun.java</b> - <br>
    You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?
    Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n       such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.
    If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is positive.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <b>StringSplit.java</b> - <br>
    Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second     character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <b>PigLatin.java</b> - <br>
    IN PROGRESS<br>
    Move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "ay" to the end of the word. Leave punctuation marks untouched.
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>UniqueInOrder.js</b> - <br>
    Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and             preserving the original order of elements.
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>C#</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>BitCounting.cs</b> - <br>
    Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that         input is non-negative.
    Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <b>WhoLikesIt.cs</b> - <br>
    You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed     next to such an item.
    Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take in input array, containing the names of people who like an item. For 4 or more names, the number in and 2       others simply increases.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <b>ListFilterer.cs</b> - <br>
    IN PROGRESS<br>
    In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.
  </li>
</ul>
</div>
